<h2>Tally Hall</h2>
<p>
THIS IS A <b>TALLY HALL</b> SONG, ALL <b>CREDIT TO TALLY HALL</b><br> <br>
Welcome to Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum<br>
Known from coast to coast like butter and toast<br>
From headlines to bedlines<br>
From school rooms to pool rooms<br>
No other place in the contiguous United States<br>
Or other environments of the world<br>
Welcome"<br><br>
Can I get a T? (T)<br>
And if you hit me with the A-L-L-Y<br>
Then you'd see why<br>
The Hall is here for y'all<br>
The mini mall is calling us all in<br>
So kids pack up your mom's car<br>
Back up the Windstar<br>
Kick it in drive and arrive at the mega mart<br>
Slide the side hatch with pride 'cause your ties match<br>
On booty duty like your name was Eddy Thatch<br><br>
W-W-T-H-D<br>
We like to kick it at the university<br>
But all work and no play makes us crazy<br>
So, we jump in the bumping SUV<br>
Hit the street get the sweet tunes on<br>
Do a donut on your mama's front lawn<br>
And sooner than you know<br>
You've found the rock 'n' roll show<br>
At the Tizzy Hizzy we'll be gone<br><br>
We're in the mini mall<br>
Working the carnival<br>
We like to play it all<br>
Welcome to Tally Hall<br><br>
The automated players, I proclaim<br>
Yellow tie, this suave fellow writes<br>
Heterophonic tunes of how love bites<br>
Red the proud loud guy we adore<br>
(Is my amp too high?)<br>
No, turn it up more<br>
So Grey in the back sipping 'gnac can hear<br>
He's knocking down the shots like Bill Laimbeer<br>
Send home the locksmith, Green's got keys<br>
To unlock the rock in the act, if you please<br>
Now open the gates<br>
Give Blue the bass<br>
And jiggle your badiggle all over the place<br><br>
We're in the mini mall<br>
Working the carnival<br>
We like to play it all<br>
Welcome to Tally Hall<br><br>
We're in the mini mall<br>
Working the carnival<br>
We like to play it all<br>
Welcome to Tally Hall<br><br>
Can I get a click<br>
Flick off the switch<br>
And we'll ignite the night in pitch<br>
Sing songs you like to hear<br>
And the world will disappear<br>
Then we'll be glowing in the dark<br>
Lighting up the park<br>
Revealing that the Hall is the place that aims to please<br>
With unpredictable games and antiquities<br>
The collectables so delectable<br>
The unreliable style's undetectable<br><br>
Like I might rap like an English chap<br>
Take you by the knickers and I'll bum your slap<br>
You didn't think we had the gall<br>
Well bloody welcome to Tally Hall<br><br>
We're stereosonic<br>
We're animatronic<br>
We're rocking with the robo-electronic Ebonics<br>
A quick distraction<br>
A mechanic attraction<br>
Got a penny in your pocket for the slot<br>
Rock<br><br>
Hey ho, don't you know<br>
It's a good old-fashioned puppet show<br>
That's right quite the set<br>
We're the marionette quintet<br><br>
We think we're playing in a band<br>
But we'd love to give you all a hand<br>
(Woo)<br><br>
We're in the mini mall<br>
Working the carnival<br>
We like to play it all<br>
Welcome to Tally Hall<br><br>
We think we're playing in a band<br>
But we'd love to give you all a hand<br>
We think we're playing in a band<br>
But we'd love to give you all a hand<br>
We think we're playing in a band<br>
But we'd love to give you all a hand<br>
<br><br><br><b>I'm not going to add more songs so now it will just be song refrences.</b><br>
I've even writen this whole song about you<br> and not about me, and not about me<br>
Please don't just laugh and clap right, this is serious, I'm not delirious
<br><br>
EVERYBODY LIKES TO TAKEN FOR TURNS, TO SEE HOW BRIGHT THE FIRE IN SIDE OF BURNDS<br><br>
You understand mechincal hands, you'er the ruler of everything,(ah) the ruler of everything<br><br>
I have a wonderful wife, a have a powerful job, she criticizes for being egosentric<br>
You pratice you manerinsmes into the wall, if this mirrow appears I'll be staning so tall
<br><br>John and Yoko, dark and light, it's almost time to say goodnight to it<br><br>
Well, let me tell you a story my situation<br>
I was talking to this girl from the US nation<br><br>
It was them and you and me, stringing electricty<br> And the rest of it is waiting under<br><br>
This town without love, too much faith in above<br><br>
Looking for a cavern, a place where she can stay<br><br>
I'd like to say hello and welcome you, good day, that is is my name<br><br>
Nothing goes right in its time<br><br>
I thought you knew I knew but<br>
Why and by and why and by and by<br><br>
Let us sing, let us sing, let us sing let us sing<br><br>
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah<br><br>
"no I don't, I only have a friend"<br><br>
Oh baby You, you go what I need<br><br>
Stone & glass<br><br>
And in between, eternally<br><br>
Going once, going twice, every man here has a price<br><br>
Going once, gonig twice, won't these gentalmen suffice<br>
Any here? Any there?<br>
Any motions anywhere?<br>
Going twice going thrice<br>
Guess this means we'll go four times a lady<br><br>
I promise I'll be all you need, ever need<br><br>
We were playing in the sand<br>
and you found a liitle band<br>
You told me you fell in love with it, hadn't gone as I planed<br><br>

<h2>Will Wood</h2>
<p>WILL WOOD IS ALSO GREAT<br>
Here is <b> OUTLIERS AND HYPOCRITES: A FUN FACT ABOUT APPLES</b> by <b> WILL WOOD</b> all credit to <b>WILL WOOD</b><br><br>

Did you know that the hole in the apple didn't come from the outside in?<br>
It was eaten from the core and out to the skin<br>
And that's why you'll never find the worm in it<br>
But a few bad ones won't spoil the eyes, if they fall far enough from the tree<br>
The rind is all you see, leave Eden with my seeds in your stomach<br><br>
Well, this disease is defined by its treatment, you people make me sick<br>
Parlance of imbalanced, cambia's been challenged at best<br>
AstraZeneca's just theoretical<br>
Prints of your fingers in the Rorschach jigsaw, say you saw a treasure map<br>
Straight-jacket and tie, psychiatric supply, while we tragically try to fit into a trap, but<br><br>
Who'd want to be human anyway? (Ay, ay, ay, ay)<br>
Who pilots all these crude machines?<br>
Why'd you come into this world or come out that way?<br>
Like freaks of nurture, well, isn't it funny?<br>
(Well, not ha-ha funny, but y'know, funny)<br><br>
'Cause I doubt that you would even if you could change<br>
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange<br>
I doubt that you would even if you could change<br>
The things that make you special are the things that make you strange<br><br>
I am the shadows cast aside by gallows, and you the red-hot sky<br>
And if you're believers, then why would you grieve for the dead<br>
Instead of a devil that you never prayed for?<br>
You become immune to my toxic fumes<br>
My dose-dependent presence in your life<br>
It's all subjective, all due respect to the collective mind, but<br><br>
Too weird to love, too scared to die (ay, ay, ay, ay), too alien to take you home<br>
Horrified at the sight of my reflection in your eyes, I don't belong there<br>
Well, it's your conclusions that make mine delusions, so I make you sane<br>
You can thank me later<br><br>
Well, I doubt that you would, even if you could change<br>
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange<br>
I doubt that you would, even if you could change<br>
The things that make you special are the things that make you strange<br><br>
Who'd want to belong to anyone? (Ay, ay, ay, ay) I mean, what do people even do?<br>
So, if you love me, let me let you go, my love (ay, ay, ay, ay), so I can be no one<br>
When Chuang-Tzu awoke, he sat up almost choking<br>
Spat out a butterfly and said, "Five more minutes, please?<br>
You wouldn't believe the dream I just had<br>
I mean, you were there, and you were there<br>
And you, and you, and you were there"<br><br>
'Cause I doubt that you would, even if you could change<br>
The things that make you special are what make you strange<br>
I doubt that you would, even if you could change<br>
The things that make you special are the same that make you<br><br>
I doubt that you would even if you could change<br>
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange<br>
I doubt that you would even if you could change<br>
The things that make you special are the same that make you strange<br>


<br><br><br><b>REFRENCES, I'm not adding another song, so here just some lyrics that I like and are<em> ICONIC</em></b><br>
I'm that first person they talk about, in the books<br><br>
Imagine protagonist just died in the first scence<br><br>
I'm the main charater and you have to like me<br><br>
IMAGINE IF ANTAGONISTS LACKED ANY EVIL SCHEME<br>
I'm the gap between a tragedy and comedy<br><br>
I loot plot armor from NPCs<br>
Well, they are to me<br><br>
Look in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, no it's superego<br><br>
So tie me to the train tracks, laugh, and snidely twist your mustache<br>
(yes, these were all <em><b> The Main Charater</em></b> quotes, <em> don't come at me</em>, this was the shortened list of refrences, that song is so good)<br><br>
WELL HE COLAPSED WITH STEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROM ON THE ER FLOOR(do you want see how much of this on can write on memory alone?
(Note: The followig refrences are not me writing all I can on memory alone) I'm learing to sing it during my singing leasons
(In may 2024 I listened to BlackBoxWarrior - OKULTRA 27 times on spotify, I don't think I used spotify everyday that month, soooooo yeah, I know the lryics pretty well)<br><br>
The way he spun his butter fly risked all six his phalanges<br><br>
And thought flight-orfight revelations shame the Box Warrior<br><Br>
His ego a mosquito, evil incarnate good incognito<br><br>
for what, for what, for what it's worth, if it was going kill you boy, it would have by now<br>
for what, for what, for what its worth there's no more looking back it's looking up or looking down<br><br>
And a tattoo of a blue jay on face<br><br>
"Happy birthday to the succulents, I'll die your hydroponics"<br><br>
Auf wiedershen, au revoir, he gripped his wits right by their ends<br><br>
Holistic bllistics, you got a better idea?<br>
It's about the best we could come up with, what, you think ideas spread becasue they're good?<br>
No, they spread becasue people like them<br>
So here we are once again, holding<br>
holding as it were a mirror up to your mirror<br>
I guess it's just something people do<br><br>
Why thine own self be true when it is you are the problem<br><br>

That everything and everyone goes with the passage of time<br><br>
'cause a normal human beging wouldn't need, to pretend to be normal, to be normal<br><br>
I want you to look to your left, look to your right
Your 12 o'clock, three o'clock, six o'clock, nine o'clock, rock around the clock tonight<br><br>
BUT THAT YOU LOVE THEM EXACTLY THE WAY THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS!<br><br>
Just a little old me in big, big world<br><br>
Peter pan collars, but my daughter's growing up<br><br>
Baby, could you play along with me?<br><br>
Everybody knows that<br>
nobody knows that<br><br>
This isn't my first anything!<br><br>
I'm cut from a diffrerent kind of meat<br><br>
Baby, I may be crazy, but I didn't lose it, no I just set it free<br><br>
Vice versa, vice versus viture<br><br>
Now with my moral compass pointing south, going down<br><br>
I hold myself in contempt<br><br>
Tears pages from spines as she judges the cover<br>
And shamelessy spoils the end<br><br>
Insisting that she won the game<br><br>
Disease is her primary lanuage<br><br>
Joe met daisy on day of the dead<br><br>
Oh, your time is comin' fast<br>
and the ferryman only deals in cash<br><br>
"Oh, I hope you like champangne with cyanide"<br><br>
Have you ever died in a nightmare?<br><br>
Ohh, could you take a look at me?<br><br>
We've all got evedence of innocence, it's "everthing's coincidence"<br><br>
Am I bad, am I bad, am I bad,am I really that bad?<br><br>
White picket fences<br>
Barbed wire and trenches<br><br>
It don't look like survial, b-but byt now or die<br>
Suburbia<br><br>
It's only Culture<br><br>

<b>Well, that was fun goodbye!</B>
